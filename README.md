# FA-GAT
First-order Approximation of Graph Attention Networks.

This work is motivated by recent linear Transformer, you can see [draft](./draft.pdf) for details. However, my present body health can't support me to complete this work. If there is anyone who wants to make it a publication, welcome contact me. Otherwise, I just leave this repo to community.

May the world be shining with kindness and goodness.

## Overview
Here we provide the implementation of a Graph Attention Network (GAT) layer in TensorFlow, along with a minimal execution example (on the Cora dataset). The repository is organised as follows:
- `data/` contains the necessary dataset files for Cora;
- `models/` contains the implementation of the GAT network (`gat.py`);
- `pre_trained/` contains a pre-trained Cora model (achieving 84.4% accuracy on the test set);
- `utils/` contains:
    * an implementation of an attention head, along with an experimental sparse version (`layers.py`);
    * preprocessing subroutines (`process.py`);
    * preprocessing utilities for the PPI benchmark (`process_ppi.py`).

Finally, `execute_cora.py` puts all of the above together and may be used to execute a full training run on Cora.

## Sparse version
An experimental sparse version is also available, working only when the batch size is equal to 1.
The sparse model may be found at `models/sp_gat.py`.

You may execute a full training run of the sparse model on Cora through `execute_cora_sparse.py`.

## Dependencies

The script has been tested running under Python 3.5.2, with the following packages installed (along with their dependencies):

- `numpy==1.14.1`
- `scipy==1.0.0`
- `networkx==2.1`
- `tensorflow-gpu==1.6.0`

In addition, CUDA 9.0 and cuDNN 7 have been used.
